## Mixture-of-Attention (wip)

Some personal experiments around routing tokens to different autoregressive attention, akin to mixture-of-experts

Learned from researcher friend that this has been tried in Switch Transformers unsuccessfully, but I'll give it a go, bringing in some learning points from recent papers like <a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/CoLT5-attention">CoLT5</a>.

In my opinion, the CoLT5 paper basically demonstrates mixture of attention already for 2 experts. This just has to be generalized to greater than 2 experts, and for autoregressive case. Local attention branch would just be a special case of one expert with fixed routing. If I route only half the tokens, that would lead to a savings of 4x. If I can show even ~4 experts being better than 1 attention, that should be a win.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install mixture-of-attention
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from mixture_of_attention import MixtureOfAttention

mixture_of_attn = MixtureOfAttention(
    dim = 512,
    dim_context = 256,
    num_routed_queries = 16,
    num_routed_key_values = 16,
    num_experts = 2,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

x = torch.randn(1, 1024, 512)
mask = torch.ones((1, 1024)).bool()

context = torch.randn(1, 512, 256)
context_mask = torch.ones((1, 512)).bool()

mixture_of_attn(x, context = context, mask = mask) # (1, 1024, 512)
```

Autoregressive flavor

```python
import torch
from mixture_of_attention import MixtureOfAutoregressiveAttention

mixture_of_attn = MixtureOfAutoregressiveAttention(
    dim = 512,
    local_attn_window_size = 64,       # local attention window size
    routed_window_size = None,         # will be set to the same as local_attn_window_size if None. ideally less than or equal to local attention window size for full receptive field
    num_routed_queries = 12,
    num_routed_key_values = 12,
    num_experts = 2,
    dim_head = 64,
    heads = 8
)

x = torch.randn(1, 1023, 512)

out = mixture_of_attn(x) # (1, 1023, 512)
```

## Todo

- [x] allow for local attention to be automatically included, either for grouped attention, or use `LocalMHA` from `local-attention` repository in parallel, weighted properly
- [x] make it work for autoregressive

- [ ] try dynamic routing tokens, using projection of masked mean-pooled queries
